<h1>Simple hamburger menu for generic applications</h1>

<p>A bad menu is a bad menu. Sometimes however customers just want a menu without first going into tens of thousands of euros worth of strategy sessions.</p>

<p>Also, by the time I get involved it is generally too late to change the IAD and I have to deliver a solution that is better than 'no solution'. A hamburger menu for mobile applications should suffice in those cases (the 'no solution' solution in those cases just being a long list of links at the top of the page that the mobile user will have to scroll past on every page.</p>

<p>There is no design pattern for this. The name 'hamburger menu' creates the fallacious impression that we by definition are talking about a menu. As far as I am concerned however, site builders can put whatever they want on their hamburgers.</p>

<p>Default: the 'no solution' solution.</p>

<p>Mobile and Javascript? A part of the document gets hidden and replaced by the image of a hamburger.</p>

<p>Desktop: the 'no solution' solution.</p>

<p>For desktop you could choose to enforce the hamburger nevertheless.</p>

<h2>Application</h2>

<p>Step 1. Make sure from your web page is mobile ready (i.e. viewport is set and whatever).</p>

<p>Step 2. Link the script containing the hamburger menu code.</p>

<p>Step 3. Copy the sample styles to your style sheet and edit to taste.</p>

<p>Step 4. Call hamburger() with the ID of the hamburger element.</p>
