<h1>Simple hamburger menu for generic applications</h1>

<p>I needed a simple hamburger menu for mobile websites.

<p>There is no design pattern for what goes in the menu. The name 'hamburger menu' creates the fallacious impression that we are talking about a menu by definition. As far as I am concerned, however, site builders can put whatever they want on their hamburgers.

<p>Usage notes TL/DR: by default a menu gets shown, but if the screen is narrow and the user has Javascript, your menu will be replaced by the image of a hamburger.

<p>For desktop you could choose to enforce the hamburger nevertheless.

<h2>Application</h2>

<p>Step 1. Make sure your web page is mobile ready (i.e. viewport is set and so on).

<p>Step 2. Add a menu, give it an id to your liking and a class 'menu-hamburger'.

<p>Step 2. Link the script containing the hamburger menu code.

<p>Step 3. Copy the sample styles to your style sheet and edit to taste.

<p>Step 4. Call menuHamburger() with the ID of the hamburger element.

<h2>Usage notes</h2>

<p>@todo

<h3>Set-up</h3>

<p>In a mobile-first set-up, you will have three states: 

<ol>
	<li>Wide screen: menu is always displayed, all buttons will be hidden.
	<li>Narrow screen: default is menu is hidden, menu only has class 'hamburger-menu', a hamburger button (<span class="sample-icon"><img src="sprite-hamburger-icons.svg" alt="[example]" class="sample-icon-burger" width="24" height="16"></span>) is shown.
	<li>Narrow screen, hamburger was clicked: hamburger menu is being shown, menu has classes 'menu-hamburger' and 'menu-hamburger-show', the hamburger button has become a close button (<span class="sample-icon"><img src="sprite-hamburger-icons.svg" alt="[example]" class="sample-icon-close" width="24" height="16"></span>).
</ol>

<p>In this case, the default lay-out will be to hide the menu but show the icon. If the menu has a class 'menu-hamburger-show' or if the screen is wide, the menu will be shown. If the screen is narrow, a close icon will also be shown.

<p>Also if the visitor has a wide screen there is probably a lot more styling you will want to do to make use of the width of the screen. But I will leave that up to you.

<h3>Localisation</h3>

<p>You can pass an object containing strings as the second argument of the menuHamburger() function. 

<p>The value with key 'showmenu' contains your translation (or adaptation) of the string 'Show menu', whereas key 'hidemenu' represents your version of 'Hide menu'.

<p>I.e. <code>menuHamburger('my-id', {'showmenu': 'Open menu', 'hidemenu': 'Close menu'});</code>

<h3>Accessibility</h3>

<p>This should work, but let me know if it does not. You may wish to add the attribute 'aria-expanded' to the element with class 'menu-hamburger' and then use the Javascript to set the correct value ("true" or "false").

<h2>Questions I have been asking myself</h2>

<p>Q: Aren't hamburger menus out?

<p>A: Yes! No! Maybe? Thing is, customers unwilling to pay for intricate solutions keep coming up with intricate needs, so I had to come up with a known technology that can be used in the 'value pack'.

<p>Q: Aren't there already a thousand hamburger menus out there?

<p>A: Probably. It takes far less time to roll my own than to evaluate a thousand existing solution. Also, in our attention economy the most popular existing solutions tend to be a little, shall we say, bloaty?

<p>Q: Fail! This is not CSS-only.

<p>A: CSS-only menus are 90 % for bragging and only 10 % of using.

<h2>Todo</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Check accessibility - see also <a href="http://localhost/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?27_November_2019">here</a> for tips</li>
	<li>Name-space the hell out of this.</li>
	<li>Test in a real application.</li>
</ul>

<script type="text/javascript">
<!-- 
	menuHamburger('my-burger');
// -->
</script>

<p>@todo When JS is disabled, the menu should be shown.
