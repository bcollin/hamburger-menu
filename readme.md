A simple HTML hamburger menu. Javascript is used to hide the menu until the user clicks on the hamburger icon. The index.html contains the readme and a demonstration. 

If you want to see the demonstration online, try:  https://raw.githack.com/bcollin/hamburger-menu/master/index.html .

Make your browser window narrower or use a mobile phone (or emulator / preview) to see the hamburger menu appear. (It is possible to display the hamburger menu on a wide screen, but the demo is just not implemented that way.)
